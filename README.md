# Hey! This is Gentbox.
 Gentbox (Gentoobox) is a package website that hosts stuff. You can host whatever projects that you like, games, etc.
 
 You can run Gentbox by downloading a special version of it (gentbox setup/tuxbox) then configure it to your liking. (Packages, websites, etc.)
 
# Why "Gentoobox?"
Gentoobox is named this way because that it has the same ethos and principles as one of our favourite linux distros: Gentoo Linux.
Both Gentoobox and Gentoo Linux revolve around the same principle of having customizability and being lightweight.
